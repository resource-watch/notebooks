    "# NEX-GDDP & LOCA indicators calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the development of PREP we processed data from two climate downscaling datasets: [NEX-GDDP](https://nex.nasa.gov/nex/projects/1356/) (NASA Earth eXchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections) and [LOCA](http://loca.ucsd.edu/) (LOcalized Constructed Analogs). Both these models are *downscaled climate scenarios*, where coarse-resolution climate models are applied to a finer spatial resolution grid. GDDP data is offered at the global scale, while LOCA data covers the contiguous United States. Data access is offered through their homepages (linked above) and through several additional data cloud repositories --[Amazon AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/nasanex/) and the [OpenNEX initiative](https://nex.nasa.gov/nex/static/htdocs/site/extra/opennex/) among them. For ease of use, we'll illustrate any examples with the GDDP data available in [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The general data structure is similar for both datasets: daily measures of three forecasted variables (minimum and maximum daily temperatures, daily precipitation) are available for two of the scenarios of the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Roughly, these correspond to different levels of radiative forcing due to greenhouse emissions. The former scenario's level of emissions would peak at 2040 and then decline, while the latter would countinue to rise throughtout the 21st century. Each of these scenarios is comprised of forecasts for a set of models (21 for GDDP, 31 for LOCA), daily, from 2006 to 2100. A historical series is also included, where these models are applied to the historical forcing conditions, from 1950 to 2006. This results in a massive amount of data: about 12 terabytes of compressed netcdf files are available just for GDDP data. This amount of data is unwieldy, so some processing is needed to reduce it into a smaller, simpler dataset. We have applied two processes on the data: first, we are calculating several climate indicators on the data, in addition to the base variables. These indicators are then used to create an ensemble measure (an average of the different models) and their 25th and 75th percentiles. These are presented at two different temporal resolutions: decadal averages and three 30-year period averages."
