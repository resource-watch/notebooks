Intensity is described via the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale, meaning each value represents the \"strongest\" cyclone within each 1 arc minute grid cell during that time.\n\n  \n  \nHurricane\u2010force winds can destroy buildings and fling dangerous debris. However, storm surge and large waves produced by hurricanes pose the greatest threat to life and property along the coast. A storm surge is an abnormal rise of water generated by a storm's winds.The destructive power of storm surge and large battering waves can result in loss of life, buildings destroyed, beach and dune erosion, and road and bridge damage along the coast. Storm surge can span hundreds of miles of coastland and can travel several miles inland. In estuaries and bayous, salt water intrusion endangers public health and the environment. More powerful storms can lead to stronger winds and larger surges. Tracking historical cyclone events can help in estimating the level of threat posed by storms in a given region.\n\n  \n  \nObservations of historical cyclone events are sparse globally, which led researchers to estimate storm characteristics using [a parametric model created by Greg Holland](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(1980)108%3C1212:AAMOTW%3E2.0.CO;2). These modeled results are based primarily on [IBTrACS](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ibtracs/) v02r01\u2014the most complete global set of historical tropical cyclones available\u2014but United Nations Environment Programme/Global Resource Information Database-Geneva(UNEP/GRID-Geneva) reconciled a wide range of datasets into a common framework. By applying modeling equations to this unified historical archive, UNEP/GRID-Geneva built a homogeneous structured cyclone database with first level basic\nmeteorological data and spatial data. This global cyclone database makes possible\npost-analysis of historical cyclone events, such as the dataset presented here.\n  \n  \n### Methodology  \n  \nThis dataset is derived from a geospatial database of historical tropical storms, which includes estimates of wind speeds and other properties across space and time. This database drew upon [IBTrACS](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ibtracs/) v02r01 as well as tropical cyclone data from Regional Specialised Meteorological Centres (RSMCs) and the Tropical Cyclone\r\nWarning Centres (TCWCs) of the World Meteorological Organisation. This database was constructed using the [Cyclone Database Manager](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.117.6313&rep=rep1&type=pdf) created by UNEP/DEWA/GRID-Geneva.\r\n\r\n  \n  \nGeospatially complete characterizations of historical tropical storms were extrapolated from historical observations using [a parametric model created by Greg Holland](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(1980)108%3C1212:AAMOTW%3E2.0.CO;2), which was selected on the basis of universal recommendation from all polled tropical cyclone specialists. Data compilation and GIS processing were executed by UNEP/GRID-Europe as part of the production of the [Global Assessment Report on Risk Reduction (GAR)](https://gar.undrr.org/).\r\n\r\n  \n  \nFor the full documentation, please click on the \u201cLearn more\u201d button or see the [source methodology](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.117.6313&rep=rep1&type=pdf) for the underlying cyclone database.\r  \n  \n### Additional Information  \n  \nResource Watch displays the [IBTrACS historical tropical cyclone tracks](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/dis015a-Hurricane-Tracks) on which this historical intensity dataset is largely based.\r\n\r\n  \n  \nResource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset.
