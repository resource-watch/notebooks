The dataset is global with 300 m resolution. The FLII was calculated from data covering forest extent, observed and inferred human pressures, and alterations in forest connectivity. \n\n  \n  \nDeforestation is a major environmental issue, but far less attention has been given to the degree of anthropogenic modification of remaining forests. Human modification of remaining forests reduces ecosystem integrity, diminishes many of the benefits that these remaining forests provide, and is potentially as significant as outright forest loss in determining overall environmental outcomes. Many global environmental agendas, including halting biodiversity loss, reversing land degradation, and limiting climate change, depend upon retaining forests with high ecological integrity, yet the scale and degree of forest modification remain poorly quantified and mapped. Mapping and monitoring forest modification globally will provide essential information for coordinated global, national, and local policy-making, planning, and action, to help nations and other stakeholders achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and implement other shared commitments.\n\n  \n  \nCreated by [47 forest experts from across the world](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19493-3#author-information), the FLII offers a timely indicator of the status and management needs of Earth\u2019s remaining forests, and demonstrates there has been a huge loss of forest integrity. Globally, only 17.4 million km2 of forest (40%) can be considered having high integrity and only 27% of this area is found in nationally-designated protected areas ([Grantham et al. 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19493-3)).\n  \n  \n### Methodology  \n  \nTo produce the Forest Landscape Integrity Index, four datasets were combined representing:\n         1. forest extent\n        2. \u2018observed\u2019 pressure from high impact, localized human activities for which spatial datasets exist, specifically: infrastructure, agriculture, and recent deforestation\n3. \u2018inferred\u2019 pressure associated with edge effects, and other diffuse processes, (e.g. activities such as hunting and selective logging) modelled using proximity to observed pressures\n4. anthropogenic changes in forest connectivity due to forest loss\n\n  \n  \nThese datasets were combined to produce an index score for each forest pixel (300m), with the highest scores reflecting the highest forest integrity, as of the start of 2019.For the full documentation, please see the accompanying article [Grantham et al. 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19493-3). \n  \n  \n### Additional Information  \n  \nFor access to the full dataset and additional information, click on the \u201cLearn more\u201d button.  \n  \n### Visualizing the Data  \n  \nOur team reformatted this dataset before displaying it on Resource Watch.
