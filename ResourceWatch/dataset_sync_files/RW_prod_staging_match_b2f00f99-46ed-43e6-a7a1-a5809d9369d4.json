Each pixel value corresponds to a different type (class) of physical coverage of the Earth's surface, e.g. forests, grasslands, croplands, lakes, wetlands. The classifications follow the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UN-FAO) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) scheme. Resource watch displays 11 discrete LCCS classifications, with all forests grouped into open or closed classes.\n\n  \n  \nLand cover plays a major role in the climate and biogeochemistry of the Earth system. Understanding patterns in land use and transitions of land cover classes over time is crucial to understand, monitor, and manage a number of processes at global level. Therefore, accurate and spatially detailed maps on land cover and land use are relevant to a broad range of issues including deforestation, desertification, urbanization, land degradation, loss of biodiversity and ecosystem functions, water resource management, agriculture and food security, urban and regional development, and climate change and are critical to make informed policy development, planning, and resource management decisions. \n\n  \n  \nThe Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) is a component of the Land Monitoring Core Service (LMCS) of Copernicus, the European flagship programme on Earth Observation. The Global Land Service systematically produces a series of qualified bio-geophysical products on the status and evolution of the land surface, at global scale and at mid to low spatial resolution, complemented by the constitution of long term time series. The products are used to monitor the vegetation, the water cycle, the energy budget and the terrestrial cryosphere.  \n  \n### Methodology  \n  \nFor the global land cover 100-meter resolution data, the main inputs are PROBA-V satellite observations, organized into millions of Sentinel-2 equivalent tiles of 110x110-kilometers.\n\n  \n  \nThese satellite observations are put through an algorithm, that includes:\n  \n  \n- pre-processing, sensor specific data cleaning, and outlier screening \n  \n  \n- data fusion between the 5-day 100-meter resolution and daily 300-meter resolution data;\n  \n  \n- extraction of 183 metrics, including the base reflectances, vegetation indicators, time series harmonics and descriptive statistics;\n  \n  \n- the use of 168K training points, collected at 10-meter resolution, from GeoWIKI\u2019s crowd-sourcing, for year 2015\n  \n  \n- the use of well-established, external datasets for the shoreline masking, ecological regionalisation, built-up (urban) cover, permanent and seasonal water cover, arctic vegetation, weather and topography; supervised classification and regression.\n\n  \n  \nThe classified metrics are calculated over a three year period (epoch), in three processing modes:\n  \n  \n- base maps for epoch 2015, that serves as reference for the classifier and regression models,\n  \n  \n- consolidated maps (epochs 2016, 2017 and 2018) with full years of prior and pastor data and \n  \n  \n- the near-real time (nrt, 2019) maps with one year prior and only three months pastor data.\n\n  \n  \nThe final maps are validated using an independent set of 21,700 validation points, also sourced from Geo-WIKI.\n\n  \n  \nFor the full documentation, please see the source [user manual](https://land.copernicus.eu/global/sites/cgls.vito.be/files/products/CGLOPS1_PUM_LC100m-V3_I3.4.pdf).\n  \n  \n### Additional Information  \n  \nResource Watch shows 11 of the 23 discrete LCCS classifications from the CGLS Land Cover Product. The 12 original forest classes are shown as two classes, open and closed. The ocean and unknown classes are not displayed. \n\n  \n  \nHistorical data on global land cover from 1992 to 2019 can be found on Resource Watch [here](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/soc068brw2-Global-Land-Cover-IPCC-Classification).\n\n  \n  \nThe products are provided as single-layer, internally compressed GeoTIFF files, per 20x20 degree on the [Land Cover viewer](https://lcviewer.vito.be/), as global files on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/copernicus-land-cover?page=1&size=20), and analyzed on [Google Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_Landcover_100m_Proba-V-C3_Global).\n\n  \n  \nThe annual LC product also includes data for cover fractions (%) for the 10 base classes, an indicator to distinguish forest types, an indicator for the input Data Density, and a change confidence layer (after 2015) are available in the data from the provider. The Land Cover viewer also shows annual maps of change occurrence and of change processes.\n\n  \n  \nFor access to the full dataset and additional information, click on the \u201cLearn more\u201d button.\n\n\n  \n  \nThe products are provided as single-layer, internally compressed GeoTIFF files, per 20x20 degree on the [Land Cover viewer](https://lcviewer.vito.be/), as global files on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/copernicus-land-cover?page=1&size=20), and analyzed on [Google Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_Landcover_100m_Proba-V-C3_Global).\n\n  \n  \n### Visualizing the Data  \n  \nSee the documentation on how Resource Watch retrieved the data on [Github](https://github.com/resource-watch/data-pre-processing/tree/master/soc_104_rw0_global_land_cover).\n  \n  \n### Disclaimer  \n  \nExcerpts of this description page were taken from the source metadata.
