This dataset is shown at a 3 arc second resolution, which is approximately 100 meters at the equator but [changes with distance](https://www.thoughtco.com/degree-of-latitude-and-longitude-distance-4070616) from the equator. This dataset shows constrained population estimates, meaning that population estimates were only generated in areas with built settlements, at an annual timestep from 2000 to 2020.\n\n  \n  \nAccurate population counts are an essential part of governance, influencing a range of public services and human rights. In application, this data can feed into land zonation, urban planning and public services, and it can be combined with other datasets to create informed disaster risk reduction plans. Population data is used daily to ensure equitable access to services including those that underlie critical democratic processes like voting.\n\n  \n  \nPopulation data has historically had a poor temporal resolution, being updated on decadal timeframes. Often these data have been of a spatial resolution that is too low to integrate into many essential fields including policy analysis, scientific development, and operational work. WorldPop aims to provide regular, consistent, high resolution population data through methodological innovation. This data aims to support the measurement of local populations, their characteristics and growth across national and regional scales.\n  \n  \n### Methodology  \n  \nThe most accurate current estimates of population come from housing and population censuses, which are often collected as a country per administrative unit. WorldPop generates a gridded version of the dataset through a top-down [constrained estimation modelling method](https://www.worldpop.org/methods/top_down_constrained_vs_unconstrained). The method uses satellite derived building footprint data in combination with a built settlement growth model to account for the distribution of settlements. Random forest-based modelling is then used to disaggregate the population count estimates to the grid cells identified as containing buildings/built settlements.\n\nFor the full documentation, please see the source [methodology](https://www.worldpop.org/methods).  \n  \n### Additional Information  \n  \nResource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. Resource Watch visualizes population estimates using the [constrained methodology](https://www.worldpop.org/methods/top_down_constrained_vs_unconstrained); however, the source also offers population estimates under an unconstrained methodology.

This dataset has been archived. You can still access the archived data [here](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/b6ceb159-efd8-42de-9c6a-d658801d8922).   \n  \n### Visualizing the Data  \n  \nSee the documentation on how Resource Watch retrieved the data on [Github](https://github.com/resource-watch/data-pre-processing/tree/master/soc_107_rw0_population).   \n  \n### Disclaimer  \n  \nExcerpts of this description page were taken from the source metadata.
