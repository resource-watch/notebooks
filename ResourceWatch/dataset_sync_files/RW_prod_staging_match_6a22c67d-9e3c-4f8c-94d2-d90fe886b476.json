The dataset captures location data for saltmarsh in 99 countries worldwide. The data were collected from 1973 to 2015, with most occurring after 2005.\n\n  \n  \nSaltmarshes are highly productive ecosystems that are rich in biodiversity and underpin the estuarine food web. In particular, saltmarshes serve as nesting, nursery and feeding grounds for numerous species of birds, fish, molluscs and crustaceans. Saltmarshes are extremely valuable but often overlooked ecosystems, contributing to livelihoods locally and globally through the associated ecosystem services they provide, including fish production, carbon storage, and coastal protection. Despite their importance, saltmarsh areas are declining around the world, having lost between 25% and 50% of their global historical coverage ([Crooks et al. 2011](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/18318/605780REPLACEM10of0Coastal0Wetlands.pdf), [Duarte et al. 2008](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12237-008-9038-7)). Vast areas have been lost through conversion to agriculture, urban and industrial land, while remaining saltmarshes face many other current and potential threats ([Gedan et al. 2009](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.marine.010908.163930)).\n\n  \n  \nIn light of increasing anthropogenic and environmental pressures on coastal ecosystems, global data on the occurrence and extent of saltmarshes are needed to draw attention to these critical ecosystems and the benefits they generate for people. The dataset was developed to establish a mapped baseline inventory of the extent of the global distribution of saltmarshes. The data aim to support resource management, strengthen decision-making, and facilitate tracking of progress towards global conservation targets set by multilateral environmental agreements. The UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) collated and integrated the dataset with support from Conservation International and The Nature Conservancy.  \n  \n### Methodology  \n  \nThe Saltmarshes dataset consists of data derived from peer-reviewed articles and [grey literature](https://www.greylit.org/about), including reports and databases created by governmental and non-governmental organisations, universities, institutes and researchers globally. Data in the original source materials were collected using remote sensing and field-based survey methods. Data quality ranges from high-resolution maps to low-resolution representations, with the scale varying from 1:10,000 to 1:4,000,000, with most falling within the 1:10,000 to 1:100,000 range. Data contributors were asked to submit metadata with each dataset to provide the contextual information important for informing analyses. Saltmarshes were identified in accordance with definitions provided by data sources, where available, or were determined using expert opinion (available in the supplementary material).The precautionary principle was applied to ensure consistency across designations: if the authors were uncertain about the classification of the habitat, it was not included. Please refer to the supplementary material and associated [metadata](https://data.unep-wcmc.org/pdfs/43/WCMC_027_Global_Distribution_of_Saltmarsh.pdf?1617122640) from the authors for more information regarding each data source presented.\n\n  \n  \n For the full documentation, please see the source [publication](https://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.5.e11764).\n  \n  \n### Additional Information  \n  \nResource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset.

Please ensure that the time frames of data collection (noted within the dataset) are suitable for analytical purposes. \n  \n  \n - Although mangrove data are not included in the dataset, mangrove habitat may be found in very close proximity to saltmarsh habitat in subtropical and tropical regions. The dataset may contain other habitat types such as freshwater marshes, mudflats and salt plains due to varying collection and mapping methodologies. \n  \n  \n - IMPORTANT: As the dataset contains overlapping polygons, a dissolve operation (within GIS) is required before calculating area of extent.\n", "citation": "Mcowen C, Weatherdon LV, Bochove J, Sullivan E, Blyth S, Zockler C, Stanwell-Smith D, Kingston N, Martin CS, Spalding M, Fletcher S (2017).
