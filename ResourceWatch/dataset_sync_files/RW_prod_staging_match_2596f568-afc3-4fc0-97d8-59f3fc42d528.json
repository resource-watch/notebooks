These values reflect the individual and combined value of on-reef and reef-adjacent tourism. The former includes recreational diving and snorkelling, while the latter encompasses the provision of calm waters, coral sand beaches, views and seafood. Economic value (in 2013 U.S. dollars) is estimated around the globe for every 500 meter (m) grid cell containing reefs with tourism activity, based on data from approximately 2005 through 2012.\n\n  \n  \nCoral reef tourism is a critical, undervalued ecosystem service. Coral reefs attract foreign and domestic visitors and generate revenue, including foreign exchange earnings, in over 100 countries and territories. Maps of value assigned to specific coral reef locations show considerable spatial variability across distances of just a few kilometers (km). About 30% of the world's reefs are of value to the tourism sector\u2014the remainder being too remote for tourism\u2014with an estimated total value of nearly $36 billion, or over 9% of _all_ coastal tourism value in the relevant countries. Understanding the full value of coral reefs to tourism, and the spatial distribution of these values, provides an important incentive for sustainable reef management. \n\n  \n  \nThe dataset was created by researchers from The Nature Conservancy (TNC), World Resources Institute (WRI), the University of Washington (UWash), and the University of Cambridge (Cambridge).\n  \n  \n### Methodology  \n  \nThe value of coral reef tourism was explored using metrics of monetary value (i.e., expenditures) and visitor numbers (specifically, tourist trip equivalents: a term used to account for the fact that many of the statistics are built up from fractions of total arrivals, acknowledging that reefs are only part of most destination choices). Two components of coral reef tourism were distinguished: on-reef or _in situ_ values are derived from direct non-extractive reef uses including diving, snorkelling and glass-bottom boat tours; reef-adjacent or _ex situ_ values are not derived from in-water activities, but are indirectly linked to the presence of nearby reefs. The latter may include the role of reefs in generating clear calm waters and beach sand, outstanding views, fresh seafood and even their widespread use in advertising, all of which help to draw people to coral reef regions.\n\n  \n  \nTourism was examined in the over 100 jurisdictions (countries and territories) around the world which have coral reefs. National statistics on travel and tourism for each jurisdiction were used as initial inputs. \u201cBig data\u201d from commercial, crowdsourced, and social media platforms were then used to prorate and spatially distribute the tourism expenditure and visitation to non-urban areas that could reasonably be linked to coral reefs. Paired, independent datasets were used to strengthen the robustness of the model, and the outputs were cross-referenced to existing studies. Tourism values were estimated as a proportion of the total visits and spending by coastal tourists within 30 km of reefs (excluding urban areas). On-reef values were based on the relative abundance of dive-shops and underwater photos in different countries and territories, which determined the proportion of that local coastal spending that was attributed to reefs. Reef-adjacent values were estimated as a fixed 10% of total local tourism expenditure. Finally, these tourism values were linked back and assigned to the reefs that were considered to be generating these values.\n\n  \n  \nFor the full documentation, please see the source [methodology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X17300635).\n  \n  \n### Additional Information  \n  \nResource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset.
