The 4 kilometer (km) resolution projections are global, running from 2000 through 2100. Coral communities will start to change when bleaching becomes more frequent than twice per decade: corals susceptible to bleaching will be less common and the structural complexity of many coral reefs will decline. These changes will occur even more rapidly when bleaching events begin to occur annually.\n\n  \n  \nThese projections are based on future greenhouse gas emission rates determined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC\u2019s) Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5. The RCP 8.5 scenario presumes no decrease in greenhouse gas emission rates within the 21st century. More information on these scenarios can be found [here](http://tntcat.iiasa.ac.at:8787/RcpDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&page=about).\n\n  \n  \nMass coral bleaching events due to unusually warm ocean water have increased in frequency and severity, and have become one of the most significant contributors to the deterioration of the world's coral reefs. Furthermore, bleaching events are expected to become more frequent and more severe in the decades ahead. Thermal stress that persists for several weeks with ambient water temperatures as little as 1 to 2 \u00b0C above a coral\u2019s thermal tolerance level has been shown to cause bleaching, often on broad geographical scales. Corals can die if thermal stress is severe or long-lasting or if it leads to disease in the colony. Extensive bleaching events have dramatic long-term ecological and social impacts, including loss of reef-building corals, changes in benthic habitat, changes in associated fish populations and economic loss. Even under favorable conditions, it can take decades for severely bleached reefs to fully recover. As the climate continues to warm, bleaching is a major threat to the future of coral reefs.\n\n  \n  \nThere is great variation in the projected timing of when severe bleaching conditions will become an annual occurrence in most coral reef regions. These large variations can even be seen within a single country\u2019s coral reefs. Reefs projected to experience annual severe bleaching 10 or more years later than other reefs in the same country or territory are considered to be relative refugia: they may provide refuge for aquatic creatures living in surrounding areas with higher levels of bleaching. These relative refugia should therefore be conservation priorities. The projected timing of annual severe bleaching varies by 10 or more years in 71 of the 87 countries and territories with at least 500 square kilometers of reef area. This suggests that these projections should be taken into consideration in most reef areas during conservation and management planning.\n\n  \n  \nCoral reefs are among the most biologically rich and productive ecosystems on earth and provide valuable ecosystem benefits to millions of people in coastal areas. They are, however, widely threatened by both local threats (such as overfishing, pollution, and direct physical damage) and the global threats of ocean warming and acidification. These have already caused widespread damage to most of the world\u2019s coral reefs, resulting in reduced areas of living coral, increased algal cover, diminished species diversity, and lower fish abundance, as well as degraded economic and social benefits to many coastal communities.\n  \n  \n### Methodology  \n  \nEnsembles of climate models were used to generate projections of the year when severe coral bleaching events will start to occur annually, and of changes in aragonite saturation state. The models were used to generate projected monthly data for the following variables: sea surface temperature (SST), surface pressure of carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), pH, and salinity. Each model independently generated monthly data for the listed variables, and these model outputs were then adjusted to the mean (within the annual cycle) of observations of SST based on the [OISST V2 1982\u20102005 climatology](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oisst/optimum-interpolation-sea-surface-temperature-oisst-v20). \n\n  \n  \nThe sea water temperature stress that triggers bleaching is measured in degree heating weeks (DHWs). One degree heating week is equal to one degree above the long-term average summer maximum temperatures for one week. Severe bleaching is common when thermal stress exceeds 8 DHWs.\n\n  \n  \nBoth bleaching frequency projections have been produced for emissions scenarios RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 (for a total of four projections). RCP8.5 is a \"business-as-usual\" scenario that assumes emissions increase unabated. At time of dataset production in May of 2016, emissions concentrations were greater than what RCP8.5 had projected for 2016. RCP4.5 assumes emissions stabilize just after 2100 due to successful implementation of climate policies that reduce emissions.\n\n  \n  \nThese projections are unique in that they have been produced through statistical downscaling so have high resolution (4km) relative to raw climate model data (~1x1\u00b0), i.e. relative to the projections [here](https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/climate/projections/piccc_oa_and_bleaching/index.php). The final outputs represent the ensemble average, with 33 climate models from the [Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 5 (CMIP5)](https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/cmip5/) of the [International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)](http://www.ipcc.ch/) used for RCP8.5 and 35 used for RCP4.5.\n\n  \n  \nFor the full documentation, please click on the \u201cLearn more\u201d button.\n  \n  \n### Additional Information  \n  \nResource Watch shows only the subset of the dataset corresponding to severe bleaching under the RCP 8.5 scenario. The full dataset includes equivalent data layers about the onset of 2x and 10x per decade bleaching under the RCP 4.5 scenario. Projection results are available in the form of Google Earth files, map images, and ArcGIS-compatible spatial data. The projections can also be viewed on [the UNEPLive site](http://uneplive.unep.org/) under the Coral Reefs theme. The [About page](http://uneplive.unep.org/theme/index/19#about) on UNEPLive also describes the main findings of the research project and discusses the conservation, management and policy applications of the downscaled projections.
