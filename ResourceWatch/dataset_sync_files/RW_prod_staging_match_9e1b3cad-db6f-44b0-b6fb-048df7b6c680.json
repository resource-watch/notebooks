Resource Watch presents a record of the caloric value of ocean-sourced food (also known as \u2018blue food\u2019) in a country\u2019s food supply from 1961 to 2018. This indicator takes into account marine plants and animals as well as their processed food derivatives and is measured in kilocalories per person per day. This data comes from the Food Balance Sheets produced by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and is aggregated by the Resource Watch team to sum all ocean-derived food commodities.\n\n  \n  \nFish and plant production from the sea has increased over time, providing an important food source for many across the globe.  Although fish provided an average of only about 35 calories per capita per day in 2017, according to the [FAO](http://www.fao.org/3/ca9229en/ca9229en.pdf), fish play an important role in global food provision, accounting for about 17 percent of animal protein and 7 percent of all protein consumed by humans. This number is even higher in some developing regions and many small island developing states, which derive 50 percent or more of their animal protein from aquatic foods. The ocean contributes a major portion of the world\u2019s fish products, with ocean-based production representing nearly 90 percent of global landings from capture fisheries and about a third of aquaculture production. As the global population and people\u2019s incomes rise, the demand for ocean-derived food will continue to grow. [By some estimates](http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/wsfs/docs/expert_paper/How_to_Feed_the_World_in_2050.pdf), nearly 500 million metric tons of animal meat will be required to feed the global population in 2050. Because of its reduced impact on climate change, feed efficiency, production potential, nutrition, and accessibility, food from the sea [has a large potential to meet this need](https://oceanpanel.org/sites/default/files/2019-11/19_HLP_BP1%20Paper.pdf). \n\n  \n  \nThe FAO Food Balance Sheets (FBS) present a comprehensive and consolidated resource for assessing the pattern of a country\u2019s food supply and its utilization on an annual basis.\nThe FBS data are generally used to support policy analysis and decision-making, to provide an\nassessment of self-sufficiency, to estimate whether nutritional requirements are met, and as a major element for projection of food demand. For fish and fish products, they also represent a useful tool to monitor the development in overall domestic fish availability and utilization, reveal changes in the types of species consumed, and give an indication of the role of fish in total food supply and its share in animal and overall proteins. \n  \n  \n### Methodology  \n  \nFood Balance Sheets (FBS) are compiled every year by FAO, mainly with country-level data on the production and trade of food commodities. Using this data and the available information on loss coefficients, stock changes, and types of utilization, available food supplies are calculated. This is achieved by taking domestic production (capture fisheries and aquaculture), minus non-food uses, minus exports, plus imports, plus or minus variation in stocks.\n\n  \n  \nSpecific food composition factors are then applied to the related supply of each product type in order to\nobtain calories, proteins and fats. In order to have comparable statistics applicable to all countries in the world, data are then converted into primary equivalent (live weight equivalent, i.e. the weight of the fish at the time of harvest) using specific technical conversion factors.  The per capita supply of each item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the resident population.\n\n  \n  \nFor the full documentation, please see the source [methodology](http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/documents/FBS/New%20FBS%20methodology.pdf).\n  \n  \n### Additional Information  \n  \nResource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. Additional data for other commodities and food supply components as well as the full time series are available from the data provider.

The FAO Food Balance Sheet data was aggregated by the Resource Watch team by summing the total dietary energy supply coming from ocean-derived food commodities by country. The FAO Food Balance Sheet categories that were considered ocean-derived food commodities and summed include: Demersal Fish (2762); Pelagic Fish (2763); Marine Fish, Other (2764); Crustaceans (2765); Cephalopods (2766); Molluscs, Other (2767); Meat, Aquatic Mammals (2768); Aquatic Animals, Others (2769); Aquatic Plants (2775); Fish, Body Oil (2781); and Fish, Liver Oil (2782). See the documentation on how Resource Watch processed the data on [Github](https://github.com/resource-watch/data-pre-processing/tree/master/foo_061_rw0_blue_food_supply).\n\n  \n  \nThis data has been mapped on Resource Watch by joining it with Natural Earth boundaries. \n  \n  \n### Disclaimer  \n  \nExcerpts of this description page were taken from the source metadata and the [The Future of Food from the Sea Blue Paper](https://oceanpanel.org/sites/default/files/2019-11/19_HLP_BP1%20Paper.pdf) commissioned by the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy.", "source": "FAO", "info": {"rwId": "foo.061.rw0", "data_type": "Tabular", "name": "Food from the Sea", "sources": [{"source-name": "", "id": 0, "source-description": "Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)"}], "technical_title": "Food Balance Sheets (aggregated to sum ocean-derived food commodities)", "functions": "Daily per-capita dietary energy supply of ocean-sourced food ", "cautions": "- FBS data refers to \u201caverage food available for human consumption\u201d and not to the amount effectively eaten.\n  \n  \n\n- Data for production from subsistence and recreational fisheries, as well as for cross-border trade between some developing countries, may be incomplete, which may lead to underestimation of consumption. \n  \n  \n\n- Note that FAO's methodology for Food Balance Sheets changed for 2014 estimates and after, which may limit comparability pre and post-2014.
