Concentrations are presented in milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3). Chlorophylls are pigments found in photosynthetic plants that transform sunlight into energy. Chlorophyll-a is a certain type of chlorophyll found in green plants and is responsible for their green hues. Chlorophyll-a concentration in the ocean is used as a way of measuring phytoplankton. High concentrations of chlorophyll-a indicate a large amount, or bloom, of phytoplankton. Phytoplankton are small floating plants that form at the surface of the ocean. Chlorophyll-a concentrations were derived from data measured by a remote sensor aboard the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Aqua satellite. Satellite data was collected daily at a spatial resolution of 1 kilometer (km) and averaged at the end of each month. \n\n  \n  \nChlorophyll concentration maps provide valuable information about the health of the oceans and Earth's climate system. They can be used to measure changes in oceanic productivity and model the Earth\u2019s carbon and nitrogen cycles. The near real-time data is particularly useful for tracing oceanographic currents, jets and plumes. Most phytoplankton blooms are a sign of good ocean health, such as the large blooms that occur in the North Atlantic Ocean every spring. As they grow, phytoplankton take in carbon dioxide and produce oxygen, which could have a positive impact on climate change. However, some phytoplankton blooms can grow out of control into harmful algal blooms. As phytoplankton rapidly die and decay, they can rob the ocean of oxygen and create dead zones where fish and other marine organisms cannot survive. \n\n  \n  \nThe Chlorophyll Concentration dataset is a combination of work from several organizations within [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/). The [Aqua satellite](https://aqua.nasa.gov/) and [Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/) instrument are managed by [NASA\u2019s Earth Observing System (EOS) Project Science Office](https://eospso.nasa.gov/). Satellite data is processed by [NASA\u2019s Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG)](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/) and satellite imagery is generated by [NASA Earth Observations (NEO)](https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/). Collectively, these groups work towards improving the understanding of the Earth as a system by providing a picture of climate and environmental changes as they occur.\n  \n  \n### Methodology  \n  \nChlorophyll Concentration (mg/m3) was derived from ocean color data measured by the MODIS remote-sensing instrument aboard NASA\u2019s Aqua satellite. Launched in 2002, the Aqua satellite views the entire surface of the Earth every two days and continuously measures data in 36 spectral bands. The primary product derived from MODIS measurements is [remote sensing reflectances (Rrs)](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/atbd/rrs/). Rrs is the spectral distribution of reflected visible solar radiation upwelling from below the ocean surface and passing through the boundary between the ocean and the atmosphere . Chlorophyll Concentration was calculated by two algorithms: the standard band ratio algorithm (OC3M) merged with the color index (CI) of [Hu et al. (2012)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1029/2011JC007395). Both algorithms use the empirical relationship derived from in-situ measurements of chlorophyll near the ocean\u2019s surface and MODIS-measured Rrs in the blue-to-green region of the visible color spectrum. The CI algorithm was used for chlorophyll retrievals below 0.15 mg/m3 and the OC3M algorithm was used for chlorophyll retrievals above 0.2 mg/m3. For chlorophyll retrievals between those values, the CI and OC3M algorithm were blended using a weighted approach. Additional information about the chlorophyll-a algorithm can be found [here](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/atbd/chlor_a/). \n\n  \n  \nSatellite data was measured daily at a 1 km spatial resolution. The final Chlorophyll Concentration dataset was produced by averaging the processed data each month and remapping cloud-free ocean bins. \n\n  \n  \nFor the full documentation, please click on the \u201cLearn more\u201d button.\n  \n  \n### Additional Information  \n  \nResource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset.
