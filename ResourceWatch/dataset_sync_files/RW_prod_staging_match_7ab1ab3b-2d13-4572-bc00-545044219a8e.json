The data set is comprised of global seagrass occurences, captured in point locations and polygons, which were measured from 1934 to 2015. These data contain information on the seagrass family, genus, and species, as well as which country the seagrass resides in and whether or not it is in a protected area.   \n  \nThis data set was created from multiple sources over 128 countries and territories. These sources include maps (of varying scales), expert interpolation and point-based samples. Before inclusion in the dataset, occurrence records were reviewed using published reports, peer-reviewed literature and expert consultation. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the data set.

As the dataset contains overlapping polygons, a dissolve operation (by ISO3) in GIS is required before surface area calculations are carried out. Based on recent genetic and morphometric analysis, Halophilla johnsonii, Halophila hawaiiana, Halophila ovata and Halophila minor are now considered to be morphological variations of, and therefore conspecific with, Halophila ovalis. Zostera mucronata, Zostera muelleri and Zostera novazelandica are now considered to be morphological variations of, and therefore conspecific with, Zostera capricorni. Note that the older components of the dataset (particularly in version 1) are likely to have been fitted to the best shoreline data available at the time, i.e. ESRI's \"Digital Chart of the World\" and \u201cMundoCart digital database(both derived from Operational Navigation Charts).
