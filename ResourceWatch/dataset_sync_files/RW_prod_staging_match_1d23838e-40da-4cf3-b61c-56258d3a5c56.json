The UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), WorldFish Centre, World Resources Institute (WRI), and The Nature Conservancy (TNC) compiled the map to provide a baseline of data to use in monitoring and managing global coral reefs. \n\n  \n  \nAccording to the [UNEP-WCMC](https://biodiversitya-z.org/content/warm-water-coral-reef), warm-water coral reefs are the most biodiverse marine habitats per unit area, due to their rich ecosystems. Coral reefs provide a habitat for a wide array of species and can be the preferred habitat for some critically endangered species. In addition, coral reefs themselves become one of the most endangered habitats on the planet. Their presence is declining as they face bleaching, diseases caused by rising sea surface temperatures and human activity, such as urban runoff and mining.\n \n  \n  \nThis dataset can be used to reference whether local developments will be at risk of putting pressure on coral reefs. It can also be used as a base layer for further research into threats to global reefs, as was done by the [Reefs at Risk](https://www.wri.org/resources/data-sets/reefs-risk-revisited) project led by WRI.  \n  \n### Methodology  \n  \nThe dataset was compiled using data on coral reef locations from a number of sources. Approximately 85% of this dataset originates from the Millennium Coral Reef Mapping Project. This project used 30 meter resolution multispectral Landsat 7 imagery acquired between 1999 and 2002. The UNEP-WCMC compiled the remaining 15% of data from other sources. These sources include data from the [World Atlas of Coral Reefs](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/resources-and-data/world-atlas-of-coral-reefs-2001) and coral reef maps reproduced with permission from the Controller of Her Majesty\u2019s Stationery Office and the [UK Hydrographic Office](http://ukho.gov.uk/).\n\nFor the full documentation, please see the source [methodology](https://data.unep-wcmc.org/pdfs/1/WCMC008_CoralReefs2010_v4.pdf?1544544636).\n  \n  \n### Additional Information  \n  \nResource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset. For access to the full dataset and additional information, click on the \u201cLearn more\u201d button.\n\nResource Watch has previously shown data for 2005. This dataset was archived because the methodology has been changed. You can still access the archived data [here](https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/3624554e-b240-4edb-9110-1f010642c3f3).  \n  \n### Visualizing the Data  \n  \nOur team reformatted this dataset before displaying it on Resource Watch.
